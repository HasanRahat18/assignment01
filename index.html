            The Bangladesh Government continues to mobilize resources to support the affected communities, such as basic food, water purification tablets, and cash grants. However, further support from charitable organizations and development partners is still desperately needed. Due to the power outage and the shortage of safe drinking water, many city-dwellers are buying bottled water at increased prices. The need for rescue and relief intensifies as days pass in the flood-affected areas.
